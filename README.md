# Data-Cleaning-and-Featured-Engineering
Data cleaning and feature engineering are foundational steps in any data science or machine learning workflow, ensuring reliable inputs and uncovering meaningful patterns. They improve model accuracy, boost performance, and enable more insightful, data-driven decisions.

Overview
This project focuses on preparing raw datasets for analysis and machine learning by applying robust data cleaning and feature engineering techniques. These steps are critical for improving data quality, uncovering hidden insights, and enhancing model performance.

Objectives
Clean and preprocess raw data

Handle missing or inconsistent values

Normalize and scale numerical features

Encode categorical variables

Create new features to improve model accuracy

Prepare a final dataset suitable for modeling and analysis

Key Components
ðŸ”§ Data Cleaning
Removing duplicates

Handling missing values (e.g., imputation, removal)

Correcting data types

Filtering outliers

Standardizing formats (e.g., date/time, text)

ðŸ§  Feature Engineering
Encoding categorical variables (e.g., One-Hot, Label Encoding)

Scaling and normalizing numerical features

Extracting features from date/time data

Creating interaction features or domain-specific variables

Feature selection and dimensionality reduction (if applicable)

Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for exploratory analysis)
